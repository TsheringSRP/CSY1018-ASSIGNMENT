  <h1 id="heading2">Learning Process</h1>
  <p id="paragraph2">First of all, I would like to thanks our respective module leader - (lecturer/tutor) Ankit Thapa sir for his dedication in our learning porcess. Following our regular academic leture/tutor classes, I honed most of my basic knowledges and skills by learning/practicing from the slides provided by UNIVERSITY. I practiced each of the exercises, links(W3SCHOOLS) attached to it and followed every process which made it easier for me to design and apply in this assignment.<br><br>And talking about my experinence in learning, it was my first time designing a webpage so, I was sort of confused on how to start. Then I googled some sample pictures of webpage that relate to this assignment. It helped me generate some ideas on page layout.<br><br>Aside from slides, I took some guide from youtube videos too which I have clearly referenced in below section of topic - (designing process). </p>
</div>

<div class="topic3">
  <h1 id="heading3">Ups & Downs</h1>
  <p id="paragraph3">Webpage designing is like an adventure to me. While learning it, I experienced many obtstacles in basic designing process too. A very first problem I faced was div overlapping problem. I had been facing it since the first day of my tutorial class. But I successfully debugged and fixed it in this assignment which later became a great help in my further designing process too. We have criteria to use grid for page layout and better scores. Following the slide (GRID LAYOUT), I began to learn about it and implement it in my assignment. But it wasn't easy as expected. I debugged a lot of overlapping problem here also making me hard to run media query for responsive mobile view design. Similarly, designing hamburger icon was easy but making it appear only mobile phones was really challenging to me. So, after spending much time and giving more effort to it I was finally able to design it according to my concept. And my each issues, solving methods and references are attached in below section of (designing process).</p><br><br>
  	<h2 id="subheading1">Module Experiece</h2>
    <p id="paragraph4">As far my module experience is concerned, I got to know about HTML when I was studying in school. At that time we were tought only theoritically, not only in school but also in +2 education. So, I didn't have any practical knowledge on webpage designing before. And as for now, getting a chance to learn it all practically, I have experienced it to be more interesting than other modules. What I experienced in this module is that basic skills and knowledges need to be strong and consider it wisely before advancing directly for any other upper level skills.<br><br>Clarifying my above statement, I had to face a lot of problems in my basic designing too. Like div overlapping, defining font sizes, adjusting background sizes and image sizes inside div, problems in giving position to items using margin instead of relative,absoulte and so on. Now, I will be describing all these mentioned problems and my designing process in below sections.</p>

    <h2 id="subheading30">Issues, solving methods & references</h2>
                   (As I used grid property for most of the parts in my page layout, I didn't face much issues here. But I faced some while making it responsive which I have mentioned below.)<br>
                   1. Using of pixels while defining margin left were resulting in width compression problem in column. <br>
                   2. So, columns width were defined using percentages instead of pixels.<br>
                   3. Learning from here same solution was applied for previous pages that had issues with column width compression problem. <br>
                   (Unlike other pages, I didn't took a reference for it's layout design)<br><br>
