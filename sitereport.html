  <h1 id="heading2">Learning Process</h1>
  <p id="paragraph2">First of all, I would like to thanks our respective module leader - (lecturer/tutor) Ankit Thapa sir for his dedication in our learning porcess. Following our regular academic leture/tutor classes, I honed most of my basic knowledges and skills by learning/practicing from the slides provided by UNIVERSITY. I practiced each of the exercises, links(W3SCHOOLS) attached to it and followed every process which made it easier for me to design and apply in this assignment.<br><br>And talking about my experinence in learning, it was my first time designing a webpage so, I was sort of confused on how to start. Then I googled some sample pictures of webpage that relate to this assignment. It helped me generate some ideas on page layout.<br><br>Aside from slides, I took some guide from youtube videos too which I have clearly referenced in below section of topic - (designing process). </p>
